This has not only left our GPUs heavily underutilized, but has also significantly affected the latency of responses received from the server. This is not an uncommon situation. Unless you are developing an application that processes large volumes of data in batch, you will likely be sending individual inference requests from the user application, leading to even further underutilization.
